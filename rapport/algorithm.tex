\section{Presented algorithm}

The goal of the algorithm presented in this article is to learn the dynamics the system, which means learn the functions $f$ and $g$ that are supposed to be unknown.
In other words, the functions $f$ and $g$ are parametrized by $\theta_f$ and $\theta_g$ and we want to learn this parameters with the maximum likelihood principle.

The complication is that both the parameters $(\theta_f, \theta_g)$ and the state sequence $(x_t)_{t=1 \cdots T}$ are unknown.
In such case where both states and parameters are unknown, a typicall approach is to use and EM algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item we begin with an inital values for the parameters $\theta_f$ and $\theta_g$.
\item We itertate the E-step and M-step :
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In the \textbf{E-step}, the states $(x_t)_{t=1 \cdots T}$ are inferred or estimated.
  \item In the \textbf{M-step}, the parameters $\theta_f$ and $\theta_g$ are re-estimated.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
