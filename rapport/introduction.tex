\section*{introduction}
This article \cite{article} presents an algorithm to learn non-linear stochastic dynamical system with incomplete observation. This algorithm is an instance of EM algorithm, estimating the distributions of the hidden variables in the E-Step and learning the parameters of the non-linear functions in the M-Step. Actually, it uses very specific assumptions about the non linearities, namely that they can be decomposed as linear combination of Radial Basis Functions plus an affine term. This assumption allows to compute efficiently the exact M-steps in order to avoid sampling issues for integral calculations, which can be very costly if they need to be done at each step.

The article provides a few keys, as to derive the machinery, but most of the computations are left to the reader. With the help of the book of Simon Haykin \cite{SimonHaykin}, from which the article was published,  and the lectures notes, we managed to derive the computations in the most general case\footnote{The absence of these computations in the initial article explains the length of this rapport, which we guess you hoped shorter. But they are critical for both the comprehension and the implementation so we chose to include at least the main ones.}. Firstly, we present them, following the guideline of the article, and then present our numerical results on simulated data.
