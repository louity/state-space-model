\section*{introduction}

This article presents an algorithm to learn non linear stochastic dynamical system.
In fact, this article only gives the general ideas of an instance of EM algorithm to learn such systems in a particular case.
But none of the computations are fully presented, leaving the work for the reader.
Indeed, this article is the sixth chapter of the book "Kalman Filtering and Neural Network" edited by Simon Haykin and the authors mention the chapter 1 for some of the computations they do not provide.
We luckily found on the internet a numerical version of that, which is otherwise available for sale for more than 100 euros.
But the graphical model they use is even not same as in chapter 1.

So before summerizing this article, we wan't to insist on the fact that we were really disapointed by the quality of that article that spends a lot of time on simple things (explaining EM algorithm principle, deriving linear Kalman filter equations) but that to nor provide the key computations (Extended Kalman Smoothing, log likelihood maximization).
It costed us a lot of time and reflexion to understand that we had to do it, and then to do it.
